suggest completing the following ten exercises (with an emphasis on
Recursion and Orders of Growth):

Here's another list of 10 suggested exercises for section 2.3 on
Symbolic Data - some consider this section to be a somewhat gentle
introduction to information retrieval by manipulating sets and trees
(for example, records can be accessed in a database using a tree-based
method like B-trees:http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/btree.html or
http://mattfleming.com/node/192)

Since 2.4 is a small section on representations of abstract data, I've
also included suggested questions for 2.5 which is on generic
operations (and just a fun section to do).
